# Coffee Rate

### 1. What tech stack will you use for your final project?
React, Node, Postgres

### 2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
It will hopefully be full-stack, but will include a sleek UI as well as some other API integrations

### 3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
This will be a website for now, but hoping to convert to mobile app in the enar future

### 4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
I want to create an app for rating coffee, similar to what Untappd does

### 5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
Anyone who loves coffee! We don't discriminate

### 6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
For now, users will input data. As it grows I will create a standard DB and API for coffee data. 

### 7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project:

#### a. What does your database schema look like?
My database will be very simple, user information as well as coffee information. There will also be reviews and rating systems.

#### b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
Adding photos can be tricky, and I will want some external API integration for marketing

#### c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
Customer information - emails, passwords

#### d. What functionality will your app include?
Logging in, adding coffee types and photos, reviewing/rating coffee types

#### e. What will the user flow look like?
Logging in, browsing coffee types and reading reviews, creating new coffee types, adding reviews to coffee types.

#### f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?
Three major ways. Having login/logout extends the reach of CRUD. I am also going to implement external API's such as SendGrid or Twilio, and perhaps a user management system for marketing.
